<p>1. Good tensile strength: holds the stitched seam securely during wash and wear.
<br>2.Smooth surface and absence of faults ensures less friction between the needle and the material during high-speed sewing. The thread must be well lubricated to increase its sewability and resistance to abrasion.<br>3.Good color fastness provides immunity to the different agents the thread is exposed to during manufacture and washing. The thread must hence be uniformly dyed.<br>
4.Low shrinkage of the thread being used on the fabric material with higher shrinkage reduces the chances of seam puckering.
